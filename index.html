        It will provide students with practical experience in complete systems development. The projects connect groups of students with supervisors and clients who are facing an ICT-based problem for which the students are required to find innovative and creative solutions. Working in groups, students design, implement and document a system. This involves project planning and scheduling, seminars and individual presentations, group coordination, research of proposed application domain, use of design methodologies, design documentation, coding, module and system integration, testing, verification, and implementation. Teams meet weekly with supervisors to discuss progress and problems.
